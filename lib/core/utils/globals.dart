An open-source data management application that focuses mainly on securely storing private information and files.

Liso uses a powerful decentralized network of computers (Sia) to route your files, making it impossible for anyone to leak or sell your data. And with Sia's protocols, your files are broken into 30 pieces, each of which is encrypted and only you can decrypt them.
